# Emotion_Detection_CNN
Emotion Detection using Deep Learning to recognize human emotions( happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger)from facial expressions. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for training and prediction, leveraging OpenCV and Keras for image preprocessing and model operations.

Features:
    Real-time emotion detection using webcam or image files.
    Classifies 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.
    Deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
    Simple and easy-to-use interface built using OpenCV and Keras.
    
Model Architecture:
The model architecture used for emotion detection is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which includes the following layers:

  1. Convolutional Layers: To detect various features such as edges, textures, etc.
  2. MaxPooling Layers: To reduce spatial dimensions and extract important features.
  3. Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for classification.
  4. Softmax Output Layer: To classify the input image into one of the predefined emotions.
